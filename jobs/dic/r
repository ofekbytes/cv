 RESTful (web service) - Representational state transfer - 
 Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. 
 Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, termed RESTful web services, 
 provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. 
 RESTful web services allow the requesting systems to access 
 and manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. 
 Other kinds of web services, such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.
